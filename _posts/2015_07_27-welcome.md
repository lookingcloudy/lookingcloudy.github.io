I've wanted to do this for some time, and here it is...[VICTORY!](https://goo.gl/photos/x79UqB7hmJCGZKLK6)

I need to create another site for my new consulting business too...more on that later.  Like so many others, I've used Wordpress in a past life.  The time has come where I no longer keep a room full of equipment at home.  Nor do I enjoye maintaining web sites.  It used to be fun, but I'm past that.  Enger Jekyll.  I can generate this static site completely on my local Mac and publish directly to [github](https://github.com/lookingcloudy).

I won't waste your time creating yet another tutorial on how to create your own Jekyll generated site.  However, here are a few resources that helped me get started:
