![Brad Schulz](http://photos.schulzfamily.org/photos/i-H77L232/0/Th/i-H77L232-Th.jpg)

My name is Brad Schulz, a technology executive living in Tampa, FL.  I have been [married](http://photos.schulzfamily.org/Other/About-Me/n-msfG3/i-fdNJMfJ/A) for 25 years (wow!) and have 3 [children](http://photos.schulzfamily.org/Other/About-Me/n-msfG3/i-fdNJMfJ/A).

Earlier in my career I used to write database and SQL related material for many different sites.  I created this site to encourage myself to write more.

The topics I read, research, and think about are mostly technology related. However, as a Christian, I am also very interested in world and people related issues.
